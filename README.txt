emwave2-extraxt_IBI

This perl script extracts the IBI recordings as found in the HeartMath emWave2 JSON blob data generated using the emwave2-export.py tool.  A file named using the start and end time of the IBI data is created for each liveIBI recording.

The format is suitable for importing into heartrate variability (HRV) analysis tools such as KubiosHRV.
